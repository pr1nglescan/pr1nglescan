# I'm David Kuang (he/him), a CS student at Columbia University.
As a beginner coder, I'm excited to show you the neat little projects I've been working on recently.
I'm open to new opportunities and eager to learn more about the world of CS!

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
An album ranker that scrapes the web for songs in a given album you input, then lets you compare the songs to output a master ranking of your favorite
songs within the album!

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
Data Structures in Java. How to use an API. Data science. And excel keyboard shortcuts!

## âš¡ Fun fact:
Competitive figure skater with the CU Figure Skating Club. Foodie at heart <3
